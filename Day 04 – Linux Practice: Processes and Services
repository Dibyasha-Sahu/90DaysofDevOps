I am doing this in my local 

Check running processes

-  for checking process i used " ps " 
     ( it shows as a running process "bash" , "ps" )

  for checking process with details i used "ps aux"
     ( it shows details of user, pid no , CPU )

  To check the live CPU/memory usage i used " top "
      ( it show me how much i used and how much memoery lived )

Inspect one systemd service

- I used "systemctl list-units --type=service" as it's a systemmd service part
      ( shows all services currently running (like ssh, cron, docker, etc)

Capture a small troubleshooting flow

- I tried to run ifconfig but the command was not found.

- I ran ls /sbin to see if it existed. It didn't.

- I ran apt update && apt install net-tools -y.

- Run if config again, and now it displays my container's internal IP address.


Pick one service on your system (example: ssh, cron, docker) and inspect it

- I’ll choose ssh (the secure shell service) 

  Check if the service process is running "ps aux | grep ssh"
