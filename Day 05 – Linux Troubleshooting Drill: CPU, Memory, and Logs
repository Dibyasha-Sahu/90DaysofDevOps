1. Environment Basics
Command: cat /etc/os-release

Observation: Confirmed I am running Ubuntu 22.04.x LTS inside a Docker container.

Command: uname -a

Observation: Shows the Kernel version. Note: In Docker, this shows the Host's kernel version, as containers share the host kernel.

2. Filesystem Sanity
Command: mkdir /tmp/runbook-demo && cp /etc/hosts /tmp/runbook-demo/hosts-copy

Command: ls -l /tmp/runbook-demo

Observation: Verified that I have "Write" permissions in the /tmp directory and the file copy was successful.

3. CPU & Memory Snapshot
Command: free -h

Observation: Checked available RAM. Since I am in Docker, this reflects the limit allowed by the Docker Desktop/Daemon settings.

Command: ps -o pid,pcpu,pmem,comm

Observation: Viewed specific resource usage. bash is idling at 0.0% CPU, which is expected for an inactive terminal.

4. Disk & IO Snapshot
Command: df -h

Observation: Checked overlay filesystem usage. The container has plenty of space available from the Docker virtual disk.

Command: du -sh /var/log

Observation: Log directory size is minimal (under 1MB) because this is a fresh practice container.

5. Network Snapshot
Command: netstat -tulpn (or ss -tulpn)

Observation: No active listening ports found yet, as I haven't started a web server (like Nginx) inside this container.

Command: ping -c 3 google.com

Observation: Successful response. Confirmed the container has outbound internet access to download packages.

6. Logs Reviewed
Command: tail -n 50 /var/log/dpkg.log

Observation: Traced the history of apt install commands I ran earlier. No installation errors found.

Command: ls -t /var/log | head -n 5

Observation: Identified the 5 most recently updated log files to see where current system activity is being recorded.
